# Keep Turning - WIP
This Repositories include a Grasshopper script written for Rhino that allow for the creation of generative artifacts. Each artifact is optomized in size, proportion, shape to be turnable on most common lathes, both commercial and hobbiest varieties.

## _Keep turning is a work in progress_
The project and its progress is detailed on my [tumblr](https://keepturningwip.tumblr.com/)
